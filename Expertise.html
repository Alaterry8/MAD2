        <p>
            I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive and user-friendly websites. 
            My expertise includes working with Ai tools across different platfoms and utilising new technology to validate code and ensure quality, which allow for efficient 
            front-end development. 
            A mix of Ai tools and manual efforts is a well-rounded approach to web development.

        <h2><i class="fas fa-project-diagram"></i> Project Achievements</h2>
        <p>
            Over the years, I have successfully led and contributed to various small projects, ranging from small business 
            websites to No code applications. One notable achievement includes developing an e-commerce 
            store app project that involved collaborating with a company to 
            build a mobile-friendly app that streamlined internal operations for a sustainability wholesaler.
